# IngenuityML Next Steps (What Will Be Done Next)

## Priority logic
- Close scikit-learn parity gaps in the Python API first.
- Promote C++-only implementations to Python bindings for quick parity wins.
- Implement missing scikit-learn algorithms by section, then revisit compatibility refinements.

## 1) Finish partial implementations
- None currently.

## 2) Expose C++-only algorithms in Python
- None currently.

## 3) Implement missing scikit-learn algorithms (IngenuityML = no)
